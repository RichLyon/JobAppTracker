ICON FILES NEEDED:

For the React app to run properly without warnings, please add the following icon files to this directory:

1. favicon.ico - A small icon for browser tabs (16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixels)
2. logo192.png - A 192x192 pixel PNG for PWA icons
3. logo512.png - A 512x512 pixel PNG for PWA icons

You can create these using any image editor or icon generator. In the meantime, the app will run without these files, but you might see console warnings.
